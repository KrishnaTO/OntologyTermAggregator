# OntologyTermAggregator

R package for retrieving and parsing term based ontologies 

This package was written as a developing library to deal with the numorous ontologies available with fragmented information. 

It can be install via R:
```
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("KrishnaTO/OntologyTermAggregator")
```

To see the functions in action, see the vignette [Ontology-term-example.Rmd](https://github.com/KrishnaTO/OntologyTermAggregator/blob/main/vignettes/Ontology-term-example.Rmd). 
It will require getting a free API key from BioOntology to run, where you can change the 'term' within the vignette.
